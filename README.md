## **Introduction** 👋

Instead of needing to trace your finger on the timebar in your physical timetable in Timetables simply just look at **At a Glance** and you instantly see what is the current period and the following period.

When you want to see which how many "Maths" period are there in this week simply just use the **period searchbar** for it in the searchbar

We beleive that Timetables should be **yours**. Thats why unline a normal timetable you can change your accent color.
