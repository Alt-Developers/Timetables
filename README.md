## What is Timetables?

Timetables is a web-based timetables program for a Simple, Customizable and Practical experience.

Instead of needing to trace your finger on the timebar in your physical timetable, in Timetables simply just look at **At a Glance** and you instantly glimpse the current period and the following period. And under that is a daily covid report so you dont need to look up google for the latest covid reports.

When you want to see which how many "Maths" period are there in this week simply just search using the the **period searchbar**.
We beleive that Timetables should be **yours**. Thats why you can change your accent color.
